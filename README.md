# Theme-Switcher-Project
This project implements a light/dark mode toggle for a webpage using JavaScript and localStorage.
When the user switches between themes, their preference is saved in localStorage, ensuring that the selected theme persists even after page reloads. The theme is applied dynamically based on the saved setting upon page load.
